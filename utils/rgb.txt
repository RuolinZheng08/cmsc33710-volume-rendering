#space:=rgb
# Format is just one line per light, with 7 values, meaning:
#   col0 col1 col2  dir0 dir1 dir2  vsp
# where the color coordinates are in the space identified by the first
# "space:=" line (rgb or hsv), and the the light direction coordinates
# (where the light seems to come from this direction) are in view-space
# if "vsp" is non-zero, otherwise in world-space.  Directions
# don't have to be normalized; that's handled by rndCtxLightUpdate
#
# Three lights, red, green, and blue, from X, Y, and Z
